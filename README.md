# BrainFuck
 Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller.BrainFuck is executed on a memory array. By default, it's a 30k-cell-long array of 8-bit integers, but some other implementations are more flexible.  There are two registers : Instruction pointer and Memory Pointer.  Finally, there are 8 instructions:  > : Move memory pointer to the right and go to next instruction < : Move memory pointer to the left and go to next instruction + : Increment memory cell and go to next instruction - : Decrement memory cell and go to next instruction , : Read char from input and store in memory then go to next instruction . : Write memory value as ASCII char to output then go to next instruction [ : Go to next instruction if cell is not null, or to the matching closing "]" if null ] : Go back to the matching opening "[" if cell is not null, or go to next instruction if null
